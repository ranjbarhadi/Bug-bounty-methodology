# introduction:
What you see here is an overview of how i approach reacon.

## Roadmap:
```mermaid
graph LR
A((Project setup)) --> B(recon-ng)
B --> C(isup)
B --> D(nMap)
B --> E(httpx)
```

## Project setup
Create Folders (subdomains, urls, ips,patterns,params,javascript). here is a good oneliner:
``` bash
export projectname=[project_name] && mkdir $projectname && cd projectname && mkdir subdomains urls ips patterns params javascripts
```

## Recon-ng
install recon-ng. use it to search Passively for subdomains ips ports
here are some of the commands you may need
```bash
workspaces create

#insert domains
db insert domain

#insert company name
db insert company

# if you have a narrow scope you can enter the hosts using this command
db insert host

# now load some modules and then run
modules load recon/domai.....
run
```

**UPLOAD ALL RESULTS INTO PLATFORM**

> `Note`: If you see domain.* you have to use the below technique:

TLD Wordlist:

https://gist.githubusercontent.com/gingeleski/b01633b07183ff572198dd7e31bbd4b0/raw/5e015d43b4e7b692be49fb3f42f03e1693c370bb/domain_extensions_payloads.txt

Ctrl+H with regex mode enabled and replace ^ with domainname

Then Use :

https://github.com/blackhatethicalhacking/Domain2IP-Converter

Then Run subdomains using httpx for urls

Use updog to offer easier workflow when uploading/checking directories locally.

For example when using a raspberry pi, or VPS it helps uploading files locally on the machine.

********************************************************************************************************************

#### 5. Use Nmap Aggressive Scan & Save to XML to Import into Bounty Platform:

```
nmap -iL ips.txt -sSV -A -T4 -O -Pn -v -F -oX nmap2.xml
```

Extra Sn1per - WebApp Mode: 

```
sniper -f /root/Desktop/Bounty/Airbnb/ips/valid-airbnb_ips.txt -m massweb -w airbnbtestweb
```
**UPLOAD ALL RESULTS INTO PLATFORM**

Examine Some Services Manually from the Cloud Platform Hive: New!

Use Metasploit + Searchsploit to manually search - note down certain areas of interest including Log4j Patterns.

This could take days/weeks - So, its a non stop process.

5b. Extra Osmedeus Scan New!

You can use on the list of IP addresses, a domain or list of URLs gathered Osemedeus with UI to go for more in depth recon/attacks on CVEs:

osmedeus server

for the UI 

## Directly run on vuln scan and directory scan on list of domains 
```
osmedeus scan -f vuln-and-dirb -t list-of-domains.txt
```

## Scan list of targets 
```
osmedeus scan -T list_of_targets.txt
```

## Get target from a stdin and start the scan with 2 concurrency 
```
cat list_of_targets.txt | osmedeus scan -c 2
```

## Start a simple scan with default 'general' flow 
```
osmedeus scan -t sample.com
```

One Liner Very Powerful Techniques New! 

Check for Heartbleed:

```
cat subdomains.txt | while read line ; do echo "QUIT" | openssl s_client -connect $line:443 2>&1 | grep 'server extension "heartbeat" (id=15)' || echo $line: safe; done
```

Extract Javascripts from domains, and fetch only the URLS from those big files, can also be used with any type of file containing huge data:

First use getJs to get the Javascripts:

```
getJS --url website.com --output /root/results.txt
```

```
getJS --input urls.txt --output /root/results.txt
```

Extract URLs directly or from a file using this one-liner:

From any type of file:
```
cat file | grep -Eo "(http|https)://[a-zA-Z0-9./?=_-]*"*
```

Directly from a website:
```
curl https://domain.xx/file.js | grep -Eo "(http|https)://[a-zA-Z0-9./?=_-]*"*
```

OSINT: (Can be done on RPI)

Check for Domain TakeOver with Takeover by M4llok 

Takeover Tool: 
```
takeover -l sub_domains.txt -v -t 10
```

**Check for open Amazon S3 buckets
```
ls | grep s3 from nuclei-templates/technologies
```

Can use nuclei -l urls.txt -t /root/nuclei-templates/technologies/s3-detect.yaml

Attack Buckets: New!

https://github.com/blackhatethicalhacking/s3-buckets-aio-pwn

6. Use ParamSpider to Hunt for URLS with Parameters automatically from wayback machine - You can also use Arjun, we are switching to ParamSpider as part of building a workflow 

```
python3 paramspider.py --domain DOMAINNAME.com --exclude woff,png,svg,php,jpg --output /root/Desktop/Bounty/params.txt
```

Technique to Clean Params from XSS:

```
sed 's/unix/linux/g' reconfile.txt
```
 
7. Use Smuggler on URLs list to test for http requests that could desync, and posting multiple chunked requests to smuggle external sources so the backend server will forward the request with cookies, data to the front end server
   
(Can be done on RPI)

```
cat list_of_urls.txt | python3 smuggler.py -l /root/location.txt
```

**Bonus**

A) Eyewitness to take Screenshots of all URLS, Will run on VPS only! New!

```
eyewitness -f /root/Desktop/Bounty/Client/urls.txt
```

```
zip -r name.zip folder
```

Examine the Results Manually


B) Pattern Check Example for Results with gf & gf-patterns: 

After you have the Parameters Gathered, we want to check for specific patterns and possible vulnerable URLs that can be attacked using Meg or other Fuzzing Tools.
```
cat /root/Desktop/Bounty/params.txt | gf xss | sed 's/FUZZ/ /g' >> /root/Desktop/Bounty/xss_params_forMeg.txt
```

Very Powerful One Liner - You can Pipe also directly to Meg.


8. Use Meg with Seclist fuzzing for Links: (Gathered from gau/arjun/paramspider/gf)

For Meg, we must remove the ‘FUZZ’ from paramspider and replace it with a null character:

```
sed 's/FUZZ//g' reconfile.txt
```
```
meg -v LFI-gracefulsecurity-linux.txt /root/Desktop/Bounty/urls.txt /root/Desktop/urls.txt -s 200
```

9. JSScanner: 

Scanning Javascript Files for Endpoints, Secrets, Hardcoded credentials,IDOR, Openredirect and more

Paste URLS into `alive.txt`

Run script `alive.txt` - Examine the results using GF advanced patterns

Use tree command, cat into subdirectories:
```
cat * */*.txt
cat */*.js | gf api-keys	
cat /*/*.txt | gf ssrf > /root/Desktop/ssrf.txt
```

Or New Method with GitLeaks: New!

Scan a Directory with Javascripts, Files, Json Etc.. for Secrets!
```
gitleaks --path=/directory -v --no-git
```

Scan a File with Any Extension for Secrets!
```
gitleaks --path=/file.xxx -v --no-git
```
 
10. Find XSS Vulnerabilities from Paramspider & Dalfox New!

Since we have params urls from paramspider, dalfox needs to know where to inject, and you can define it with XSS instead of FUZZ, so here is a command to replace this from the result, and create a new list to be used on dalfox.

```
sed 's/FUZZ/XSS/g' reconfile.txt
```

You are now ready for parsing the urls into dalfox in pipe mode:


```
cat /root/Desktop/Bounty/xss_params.txt | dalfox pipe | cut -d " " -f 2 > output.txt
```

or

```
dalfox file /root/Desktop/Bounty/xss_params.txt | cut -d " " -f 2 > output.txt
```

For Deeper Attacks add this:

--deep-domxss

Silence --silence Prints only PoC When found and progress

10 - After Recon: New!

gotty -p 1337 -w recon-ng 
```

Gau - for realtime URL extraction when performing manual search so you can have urls to attack.

Hunt for Links that have Parameters by using gau (Get all URLS) and displaying all links that have params: 

```
cat subdomains.txt | gau | tee /root/Desktop/urls.txt | lolcat
```

```
gau domains -o urls.txt
```

```
gau example.com
```

```
gau -o example-urls.txt example.com
```

```
gau -b png,jpg,gif example.com
```
